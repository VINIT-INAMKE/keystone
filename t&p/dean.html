              professionals in their field, gain insights into real-world
              challenges, and work on industry projects. These programs not only
              supplement classroom learning but also foster crucial industry
              connections that often lead to internships and job offers.

              expertise, we regularly organize workshops focused on
              communication, leadership, teamwork, and other essential skills.
              These workshops are conducted by industry experts and aim to
              cultivate well-rounded professionals who can thrive in diverse
